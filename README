Disper
------

Disper is an on-the-fly display switch utility. It is intended to be used just
before giving a presentation with a laptop, when all one wants is that the
beamer, which has just been connected, is able to show whatever you prepared.

Disper gives you the option to either clone the all detected displays, or
extend the desktop to them. Resolutions are automatically detected. For
cloning, the highest resolution supported by all displays devices is chosen;
for extending every display device gets its highest supported resolution.
For special setups requiring more detailed control, one can still use the
standard display configuration utilites.

At the moment only nVidia cards are supported. I'm still looking for a laptop
that supports XRandR 1.2 completely to develop an XRandR backend.

Generally, one would bind 'disper -c' to a shortcut key (or if you rather
like to extend your desktop, use 'disper -e'). Without an external display
or beamer connected, you'll get your laptop's full resolution; when an external
display is present, it switches to clone mode after the keypress (or extend, if
you configured it that way).

In the future a graphical user interface may be added. For now I hope that it'll
save you some time at the beginning of presentations.

The development of this program was supported Frans and Linda Reijnhoudt.
A big thanks to them!
